#### The aim of this website is to in an easy and intuitive way present useful and crucial information to people living or working in a building owned by Lomsten.

## UX(User Experience)

### Project Goal

#### The goal of this project is to build a website which allows the House owner Lomsten to offer information about their building to their tenants and partners

#### The features on the website will:

- Give Tenants and Partners more ways to interact with Lomsten (contact form, social media, phone, email).
- Provide Tenants and Partners with crucial information about the building and its sourrounding (forms, links, modals)

#### I achieved this by:

- Providing contact details and social media links in the footer section of each page.
- Providing an option to the customers to submit their contact and request details in a form under My page
- Providing information about important dates (ticker on index-page), links with information about the living (my pages and question page), links to contact (question page) and useful information about the neighbourhood (neighbourhood page)

### User Goal

#### We expect this website to be used by the following personas

- tenants: these are the people living in the building owned by Lomsten
- the caretaker: this is the people taking care about the building
- the other contractors: these are the people involved in other activities connected to the building

The personas main goal is to find information about building so that they know how they should relate, locate and act within the building. Their age span is supposed to be between 25 and 45 years old.

### User Stories

#### As a tenant I want to have a website so that....

1.  I can find information to who i can contact if i have questions or if need to solve an issue
2.  I can see what is included in the rent
3.  I know where I can find assets such as storage, laundry etc.
4.  I know how I should act in different situations (e.g., when to turn done music, if it is allowed to refurbishing the apartment etc.)
5.  I know if there is something happening that will affect my living
6.  I can find Forms, Blueprint, Invoice, Contract connected to the living so I know how to act in different situations (what is needed to been done when moving in or moving out, when to pay the bill, what is agree upon in the contract etc.)
7.  I can find information about the neighbourhood so I know where to go if I want to shop, eat, park the car etc.

#### As a constructor/contractor I want to have a website so that....

1.  I can find information to who I can contact if I have questions or need to solve an issue
2.  I know where I can find assets such as storage, laundry etc.

### Site Owner Goals

#### As a site owner, I want to create an interactive website allowing the user to easily

1.  Find information about how to relate, locate and act within the building
2.  Find information about how to contact the House owner, contractors and partners
3.  Interact and give feedback about their living
4.  Information of guidelines to save time spent anwering these question orally

### Design Choices

#### Typology

![Typology](assets/document/typography.png "Typography Lomsten")

#### Fonts

#### I have chosen Oswald in text and in logo in the Header section, Montserrat in the Footer and Roboto plus Oswald in the Main Section and Montserrat in Forms.

#### Colours

#### I focused mainly on black and white colortheme to create a clear, simple and easy to read webpage, the background color in the footer is #dfe0e4

#### Wireframes

#### The orginal idea has in dialog with my mentor been revised several of times, below you find the mockups created in Balsamiq Wireframes for the orginal idea, which after implementation was revised to meet a more modern standard
[Large Media Devices](assets/document/MP1en2.pdf "Wireframe Lomsten")
[Small Media Devices](assets/document/MP1ensmd3.pdf "Wireframe Lomsten small devices")

### Before decision to adapt a more modern design the webpage look as the mockup below

## Version Control

### Version control for this repository is managed within GitHub and Gitpod using main as default branch for the project

- To start with a New Respository was created in GitHub, named LittleS
- LittleS was than linked to Gitpod pressing the green button Gitpod in the newly created Respository
- Gitpod was than used as an editor for creating the code in this project
- Python3 -m http.server was used in the Gitpod terminal to see newly made code in the webbrowser under port 8000
- New or modified files are staged using the git add . command in the Gitpod terminal
- The changes are committed using git commit -m command in the Gitpod terminal.
- The committed changes are pushed from Gitpod to GitHub using the git push command.
- The code was deployed in GitHub selecting main branch under setting in LittleS Respository

## Testing

### Automated Testing

#### The following validation services and linter were used to check the validity of the website code.

- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
  - An open-source automated tool for improving webpages by running audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO
- W3C Markup Validation
  - This validator checks the markup validity of Web documents in e.g., HTML
- W3C CSS validation
  - his validator checks the validity of cascading style sheets (css)

### Manual Testing

#### Following steps were undertaken to test the design and responsiveness of the webpages

1. The webpages was open in Google Chrome
2. The responsivness for all underlying pages was tested by shrinking and enlarging the window of the webbrowser
3. Links were tested in enlarge mode of the webbrowser
4. Buttons were tested in enlarge mode of the webbrowser
5. Accordion were tested in enlarge mode of webbrowser
6. The code was pushed to GitHub and deployed
7. The deployed code was tested on mobile devices (iphone, Samsung devices) in accordance with step 3-6
8. As a final step the code was tested in accordance with step 3-6 on Microsoft edge webbrowser

### Fixed Bugs

#### I have encountered and fixed following bugs

Connected to index.html

- Removed underlines when hovering over links in Header Navbar following comments from Jos√© Lopez Coronado and Vahid Alvandi on Stack Overflow adding following code to style.css (see Credit-section)

- Adjusted the dropdown list to be presented to the left of the button using alternatives from bootstrapshuffle adding following code to index.html (see Credit-section)

- Removed Dots in the List in Sub Section Navbar following comments from Alexis on Stack OverFlow adding following code to style.css (See Credit-Section)

- Remove unnecessary code, images and files plus optimised size of images

- Integrated MovingIN and MovingOut checklist as modals (see Credit-section)

- Integrated textcontent about important dates in index-pages as tickers (see Credit-section)

- Removed unused font-size

- Changed colour theme of background images

- Revised design to be more modern

- Integrated accordions to present text so it doesnt overflow the pages

- changed contact form from a modal to a contact form on my pages

- Adjusted fontcolor and the opacity of the background-color of navbar to increase the contrast between them

- Defined the height and width of images so they don't change size when enlarging or shrinking the window of the webbrowser

### Known Bugs

#### Due to shortage of time following bugs are still to be handle

- The contrast between background image and text-content in contactform could be improved by changing backgroundimage
- The contrast between background image and text-content in the header could be improved by changing backgroundimage
- The user experience for mobile devices could be increased by making one part of the contract form hidden in mobile devices
- Images in Neighbourhood pages could be removed to avoid uncontrolled behavior of those when opening rows in accordion (as it is now it get motion to the screen why i decided to keep them to add to the user experience)
- A modal could be implemented for showing the blueprint

### Deployment

The website was developed using both Gitpod for constructing code which then was pushed to GitHub,  which hosted my repository. I conducted following step to deploy my code.
- Navigated and logged in to GitHub
-  Navigated to my repository [GurraT/LittleS](https://github.com/GurraT/LittleS) 
- Opened settings.
- Scrolled down to the Section GitHub pages
- Selected master branch in the source dropdown menu
- Confirmed choice by clicking on save
#### To see the endresult and open deployed code in a webbrowser following steps were conducted 
- Navigated to my repository [GurraT/LittleS](https://gurrat.github.io/LittleS/) 
- Click on the code buttom
- Selected http-adress and copied it to a webbrowser

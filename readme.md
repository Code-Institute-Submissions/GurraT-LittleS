## UX(User Experience) ##

### Project Goal ###
#### The goal of this project is to build a website which allows the House owner Lomsten to offer information about their building to their tenants and partners

#### The features on the website will:
* Give Tenants and Partners more ways to interact with Lomsten (contact form, social media, phone, email).
* Provide Tenants and Partners with crucial information about the building and its sourrounding (forms, links, modals)

#### I achieved this by:
* Providing contact details and social media links in the footer section of each page.
* Providing an option to the customers to submit their contact and request details in a form under My page
* Providing information about important dates (ticker on index-page), links with information about the living (my pages and question page), links to contact (question page) and useful information about the neighbourhood (neighbourhood page)

### User Goal ###
#### We expect this website to be used by the following personas 
- tenants: these are the people living in the building owned by Lomsten
- the caretaker: this is the people taking care about the building
- the other contractors: these are the people involved in other activities connected to the building 

The personas main goal is to find information about building so that they know how they should relate, locate and act within the building. Their age span is supposed to be between 25 and 45 years old.

 #### Colours
 #### I focused mainly on black and white colortheme to create a clear, simple and easy to read webpage, the background color in the footer is #dfe0e4 

 #### Wireframes
 #### The orginal idea has in dialog with my mentor been revised several of times, below you find the mockups created in Balsamiq Wireframes for the orginal idea, which after implementation was revised to meet a more modern standard
